SWagen is a fleet management system desktop application, created using C# language and .Net technology.

## I- Why such a project ?
This project comes to to help the driver belonging to a network or a vehicle park to use the road under the right conditions: professional driving, driver safety, assisted driving... This by sending information to the fleet administrator or to the park assistance.

## II- How it works :
This application is made for two different profiles: Admin and driver.

### `Admin `
* The fleet administrator can manage all the vehicles and drivers data (add, read, edit, and delete).
* Also, he assigns drivers to available vehicles and so on.
* He can see all the info about the park "the dashboard".
* He receives the alerts sent by the drivers.

###  `Driver `
* Before departure, the driver has the possibility to digitally check his daily tasks using a checklist.
* He can see all his affected missions and he has the possibility to search in the maps.
* He can better plan his driving and rest times.
* He sends some alerts to manager in case of a breakdown or accident... 
* He makes a personal analysis of his driving style such as speeding.
