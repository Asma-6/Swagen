SWagen is a fleet management system desktop application, created using C# language and .Net technology.

## I- Why such a project ?
This project comes to to help the driver belonging to a network or a vehicle park to use the road under the right conditions: professional driving, driver safety, assisted driving... This by sending information to the fleet administrator or to the park assistance.

## II- How it works :
This application is made for two different profiles: Admin and driver.

### `Admin `
* The fleet administrator can manage all the vehicles and drivers data (add, read, edit, and delete).
* Also, he assigns drivers to available vehicles and so on.
* He can see all the info about the park "the dashboard".
* He receives the alerts sent by the drivers.

###  `Driver `
* Before departure, the driver has the possibility to digitally check his daily tasks using a checklist.
* He can see all his affected missions and he has the possibility to search in the maps.
* He can better plan his driving and rest times.
* He sends some alerts to manager in case of a breakdown or accident... 
* He makes a personal analysis of his driving style such as speeding.

## II- How to use it :
1- At first, clone this repository to your local space from the command line with:
`git clone https://github.com/Asma-6/PYTHON.ma.git` or download the zip code. \
2- Open the ServCar.sln in visual studio if you have it, otherwise you can download it from here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/. \
3- Run the code, and test the app "all the necessary packages are in the packages folder". \
4- Another way to test the app as a real desktop application, is to install it in your computer, so all what you need is to run the executable file "setup.exe" which is in the folder setup1/Debug. \
After installing the app, you will find it in your desktop, and you can run it as a simple desktop app. \
If you have any problem related to the database, you can move the two files "Database.mdf" and "Database_log.ldf" to your new folder of the previous installation, which you will find it in your programfiles under the name of WIAH. 

## III- Improvements :
This application is made in a theoretical way, it needs a real concretization to be more practical, because all its analyses remain random such as the speed...
